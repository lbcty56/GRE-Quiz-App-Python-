The area of the large triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 12 * 8 = 48. The two quantities are equal.'

        'explanation': 'For the expression to be an integer, (n+1) must be a positive divisor of 120. We need to find the number of divisors of 120. Prime factorization of 120 = 12 * 10 = (2^2 * 3) * (2*5) = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1. The number of divisors is found by adding 1 to each exponent and multiplying: (3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4 * 2 * 2 = 16. So there are 16 divisors. Each divisor represents a possible value for (n+1). Since n must be a positive integer, n = (divisor) - 1 must be positive. This is true for all divisors except 1.

Let the 9 distinct positive integers be {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i} in increasing order.\n2. The median is the 5th term, so e = 15.\n3. To minimize the total sum, the other 8 integers must be as small as possible.\n4. The four integers before the median ({a, b, c, d}) must be distinct, positive, and less than 15. To minimize their sum, we choose the smallest possible integers: {1, 2, 3, 4}. Their sum is 10.\n5. The four integers after the median ({f, g, h, i}) must be distinct and greater than 15.

Next, find the circumference of the tire: C = 2πr = 2π(15) = 30π inches. Revolutions per minute = Total distance per minute / Circumference = 31680 / (30π). Let me re-check this. 31680 / (30 * 3.14) is approx 3168/9.42 = 336. The question probably intended for π to be cancelled out or for an approximation. Let\'s check the options. 336 is one. It seems likely the problem was designed to have a clean answer where π=22/7 might work. 31680 / (30 * 22/7) = (31680*7) / 660 = (3168*7)/66 = 48*7 = 336. Yes, using π=22/7 gives a clean answer.'
